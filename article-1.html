            <h2>The 2011 Cricket World Cup, hosted jointly by India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, marked a significant moment in Indian cricket history. With intense competition among 14 nations, passionate crowds, and memorable performances, the tournament culminated in an extraordinary final that brought joy to a cricket-crazy nation of India when MS Dhoni's Fantastic 15 won the World Cup after 28 long years</h2>

            The Cricket World Cup has been a tournament that has been the premier event of the cricketing landscape for nearly 50 years now: the 13th edition of the tournament returns later this year, being hosted in India for the fourth time. While Test cricket is still considered the ultimate form of cricket and the pinnacle of the sport, there is nothing greater than the World Cup to be won, and it can be the highlight of a player’s career. <br> <br>

          The ICC, having become the International Cricket Council overseeing a vast and growing sport in 1964, introduced the idea of a World Cup for cricket in 1971, and the logistics had been put in place to host the first tournament in England in 1975. The first three tournaments were held in England, and were quite a bit different to how they are now: they were 60-over affairs, played in all-whites, and with a red ball.
          <br><br>

          The World Cup would move to India and Pakistan in 1987, and the reduction to 50 overs was an enforced change due to fewer daylight hours on the subcontinent. Australia won their first World Cup under Allan Border, but the ODI World Cup, and the format itself, wouldn’t begin to become what it is today until the 1992 edition in Australia and New Zealand. White balls were introduced, as well as coloured clothing which has become synonymous with international cricket ever since.

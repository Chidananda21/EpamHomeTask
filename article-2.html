            The match was originally scheduled to be played on 28 May, but was postponed to 29 May due to rain—marking the first time the IPL final had been postponed due to weather. After winning the toss, Chennai Super Kings elected to field, with Gujarat Titans scoring 214 runs for 4 wickets, setting the record for the highest team total in an IPL final.Due to inclement weather, the Super Kings' innings was delayed by over an hour, and the target was adjusted by the Duckworth–Lewis–Stern (DLS) method to 171 runs in 15 overs; the team would ultimately win by five wickets, securing their fifth IPL title. CSK player Devon Conway was named player of the match. <br><br>

         The broadcasts of the match on JioCinema peaked at over 32 million concurrent viewers, overtaking the 2019 Cricket World Cup semi-final between India and New Zealand on Hotstar as India's most-watched livestreaming broadcast of all time. <br><br>
         Gujarat Titans started their season with a 5 wicket win over Chennai Super Kings at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. After a victory over Delhi Capitals they were defeated by Kolkata Knight Riders.
